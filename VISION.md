## What Is This?

**GABBATRON REVOLUTION** is more than a project—it’s a call to arms for thinkers, builders, and truth-tellers. We are combining open-source freedom with revolutionary spirit to build tools that protect what’s ours, lift others up, and break the chains of misuse.

This compiler is the beginning. A tool that helps **understand, merge, and defend** open-source licenses in a way that’s legally safe, people-first, and impossible to co-opt.

---

## Core Mission

- Build a **free, intelligent tool** to safely combine permissive open-source licenses.
- Empower developers and creators against exploitation by bad actors and corporations.
- Provide a **platform for transparency and community ownership**.
- Use tech as a **civil rights tool**—not a surveillance weapon.

---

## Why It Exists

Too much open tech is taken from its creators, twisted, monetized, and locked away.  
GABBATRON fights back with code, clarity, and conscience.

---

## What It Will Become

- A **public, open-source license intelligence engine**.
- A growing **directory of libraries, license mappings, and protections**.
- A hub for **activists, technologists, and civil society builders**.
- A **legal-technical defense tool** for those facing systemic injustice, especially in underrepresented or rural communities.

---

## Who It's For

- Coders and engineers trying to build ethically.
- Legal advocates and open-source defenders.
- Journalists, artists, and civic hackers.
- Everyday people who just want fairness in tech.

---

## Guiding Values

- **Transparency over secrecy**  
- **Community over corporations**  
- **Education over gatekeeping**  
- **People over profit**  
- **Liberation through information**

---
